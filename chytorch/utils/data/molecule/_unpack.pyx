# Format specification::
#
# Big endian bytes order
# 8 bit - 0x02 (current format specification)
# 12 bit - number of atoms
# 12 bit - cis/trans stereo block size
#
# Atom block 9 bytes (repeated):
# 12 bit - atom number
# 4 bit - number of neighbors
# 2 bit tetrahedron sign (00 - not stereo, 10 or 11 - has stereo)
# 2 bit - allene sign
# 5 bit - isotope (00000 - not specified, over = isotope - common_isotope + 16)
# 7 bit - atomic number (<=118)
# 32 bit - XY float16 coordinates
# 3 bit - hydrogens (0-7). Note: 7 == None
# 4 bit - charge (charge + 4. possible range -4 - 4)
# 1 bit - radical state
# Connection table: flatten list of neighbors. neighbors count stored in atom block.
# For example CC(=O)O - {1: [2], 2: [1, 3, 4], 3: [2], 4: [2]} >> [2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 2].
# Repeated block (equal to bonds count).
# 24 bit - paired 12 bit numbers.
# Bonds order block 3 bit per bond zero-padded to full byte at the end.
# Cis/trans data block (repeated):
# 24 bit - atoms pair
# 7 bit - zero padding. in future can be used for extra bond-level stereo, like atropoisomers.
# 1 bit - sign
